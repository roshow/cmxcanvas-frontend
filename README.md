CmxCanvas-frontend
===========

Front-end code of my HTML canvas project for reading comics and other forms of sequential art stories. Uses my CmxCanvas API. Much more info to come. 

## Build
I used Clientjade to compile jade templates into javascript for use on the front-end and SASS for CSS. For now I'm just including the compiled files in this repo to spare you the hassle.

## Running Node Server (Optional)
This repo includes a simple Node.js server. You can skip all that if you want and just point your localhost to the www folder. If you do want to use Node, install dependencies from the command line using npm:

```linux
npm install -d
```
Then run the node script:

```linux
node app.js
```
